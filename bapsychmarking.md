# BA Psychology: Ensuring fairness and accuracy in marking and assessment

Accuracy in marking classwork and exams, and fairness in the way all students are assessed, are crucial to ensuring a high quality degree which students, employers and postgraduate selectors can have confidence in. 
The Psychology Course Team at Strathclyde implements a range of measures in order to achieve this result. 

These are detailed below so you know exactly how your mark for each piece of work has been awarded.
## Staff 
The qualifications and experience of all academic staff are checked every 5 years by the British Psychological Society who also monitors the BA curriculum, resources and staff: student ratios.  All 
academic staff are either Fellows of, or are working towards being Fellows of, the Higher Education Academy, which involves gaining a qualification in teaching and learning in higher education. This qualification involves considerable formal training and demonstrates that the individual has acquired a standard of excellence in teaching and assessment.

## Levels 1 and 2 
Classwork (e.g. essays and practical reports) and class tests are marked by Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) who have undergone significant 
Psychology-specific and generic university training. 
They have pre-marking meetings where the learning objectives and marking criteria are agreed upon. 
Classwork and exams are marked in accordance with the Criteria used for Marking, developed separately for each level of the degree. Exam questions are set by the Class Leader in consultation with the lecturers teaching on the 
class, and questions are then further scrutinised by a course committee. 
All exam scripts are marked by academic staff. 
Following the marking of all classwork, class tests and exams, the class leader then moderates the marking. 
This means that the mean marks and distributions of marks from all markers are compared and individual assessments and exam scripts are sampled by the class leader to ensure that the marks and feedback given are comparable across all markers and are appropriate for the standard of work.  
All forms of assessment are marked anonymously. Students may also query a mark if they feel it is unfair or if they feel the feedback is lacking in providing them with direction in understanding the mark and/or in how to improve future work.  The assessment may be remarked by a Teaching Fellow or other staff related 
to the class and a new mark, which may be higher or lower than the original, may be awarded.

## Levels 3 and 4 
Exam questions are set in the same way as in Levels 1 and 2, but in addition the questions are sent to an external examiner atanother institution for comment. 
Most classwork and examination answers are moderated (as for Levels 1 and 2) but some elements of assessment are double-marked. 

This means that two markers independently assess the work and meet to agree upon the final mark to be awarded where each marker points out the strengths and weaknesses of the work and justifies to the other marker why a 
particular mark was awarded. If markers cannot agree upon a mark then a 3rd marker is required to read the assessment and decide which mark should be awarded. Controversial pieces of work may also be 
scrutinised by the external examiner.

The course team also try to ensure that where possible, all exam questions are marked by the person who gave the lectures on that topic and where this is not possible, all markers meet to agree the learning 
objectives and marking criteria for that particular question or assessment.  Criteria used for marking are used which are specific to Levels 3 and 4, and at this level moderation also involves 25% of exam scripts 
being marked by a different marker to check the appropriateness and range of the marks.

Both the BA Academic Affairs Committee and the Course Exam Board scrutinise the mean marks and distribution of marks for each class, both in comparison to other classes and in comparison to previous 
years. Following this, marks may be adjusted if there is evidence that the marking has been either too generous or too strict. Two external examiners from other institutions sample work across every class to 
ensure that marks are consistent within and across classes and that marks are also consistent with the marks that would be given at their own institution. External examiners may also request that the exam 
board adjust marks if they decide that they are in any way unfair.

The Course Exam Board may also adjust marks if a student has serious personal circumstances (supported by evidence) that can clearly be shown to have affected performance in a particular assessment 
or examination. Further, all students who are close to a borderline for a degree classification have their work examined again by the course team and may also be referred to the external examiner to check if
there is a case to be made to consider them for the award of the higher classification.

With these very rigorous procedures applied across a large range of assessment, the Course Team is 
confident that every student is treated fairly and decisions on marks, progression and degree classification 
are as accurate as possible. The Faculty then has a further appeal system in case any student believes that circumstances have not been taken into account or that assessment procedures have not been 
followed.

*The Academic Affairs Committee comprises 
the Course Leader, all four Year Tutors, and the SchoolDisability Contact. 

The BA Psychology Exam Board comprises members of psychology academic staff and two external examiners.
